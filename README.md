# BankingSystem
A Simple Banking System that was made using Java. This the main back-end of the Banking System and will create a Front-End on the near future.

### This project if for education-purpose only.
The main goal of this projects is to understand more the weird things in Java and playing around with it. There's a lot of rebuilding-the-wheel libraries here and it's so much better to use the existing ones on the market.

` It will have a proper front-end when the time comes / when I have the motivation to do it :) `
